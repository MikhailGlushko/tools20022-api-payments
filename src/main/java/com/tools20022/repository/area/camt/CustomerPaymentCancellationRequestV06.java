/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message is sent by a case creator/case
 * assigner to a case assignee.<br>
 * This message is used to request the cancellation of an original payment
 * instruction. The CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message is issued by the
 * initiating party to request the cancellation of an initiation payment message
 * previously sent (such as CustomerCreditTransferInitiation or
 * CustomerDirectDebitInitiation).<br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message must be answered with a:<br>
 * - ResolutionOfInvestigation message with a positive final outcome when the
 * case assignee can perform the requested cancellation<br>
 * - ResolutionOfInvestigation message with a negative final outcome when the
 * case assignee may perform the requested cancellation but fails to do so (too
 * late, irrevocable instruction, ...)<br>
 * - RejectInvestigation message when the case assignee is unable or not
 * authorised to perform the requested cancellation<br>
 * - NotificationOfCaseAssignment message to indicate whether the case assignee
 * will take on the case himself or reassign the case to a subsequent party in
 * the payment processing chain.<br>
 * A CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message concerns one and only one
 * original payment instruction at a time.<br>
 * When a case assignee successfully performs a cancellation, it must return the
 * corresponding funds to the case assigner. It may provide some details about
 * the return in the ResolutionOfInvestigation message.<br>
 * The processing of a CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message case may lead
 * to a DebitAuthorisationRequest message sent to the creditor by its account
 * servicing institution.<br>
 * The CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message may be used to escalate a case
 * after an unsuccessful request to modify the payment. In this scenario, the
 * case identification remains the same as in the original
 * CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message and the element
 * ReopenCaseIndication is set to 'Yes' or 'true'.<br>
 * The CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest message has the following main
 * characteristics:<br>
 * The case creator assigns a unique case identification and the reason code for
 * the cancellation request. This information will be passed unchanged to all
 * subsequent case assignee(s). For the CustomerPaymentCancellationRequest
 * message has been made optional, as the message might be used outside of a
 * case management environment where the case identification is not relevant.<br>
 * Moreover, the case identification may be present at different levels:<br>
 * - One unique case is defined per cancellation request message: If multiple
 * underlying groups, payment information blocks or transactions are present in
 * the message and the case assignee has already forwarded the transaction for
 * which the cancellation is requested, the case cannot be forwarded to the next
 * party in the chain (see rule on uniqueness of the case) and the case creator
 * will have to issue individual cancellation requests for each underlying
 * individual transaction. In response to this cancellation request, the case
 * must also be present at the message level in the Resolution of Investigation
 * message.<br>
 * - One case per original group, payment information or transaction present in
 * the cancellation request: For each group, payment information block or
 * transaction within the payment information, a unique case has been assigned.
 * This means, when a payment instruction has already been forwarded by the case
 * assignee, the cancellation request may be forwarded to next party in the
 * payment chain, with the unique case assigned to the transaction. When the
 * group can only be cancelled partially, new cancellation requests need however
 * to be issued for the individual transactions within the group for which the
 * cancellation request has not been successful. In response to this
 * cancellation request, the case must be present in the cancellation details
 * identifying the original group or transaction in the Resolution of
 * Investigation message.<br>
 * - No case used in cancellation request message:<br>
 * The cancellation of a payment instruction can be initiated by either the
 * debtor/creditor or any subsequent agent in the payment instruction processing
 * chain.
