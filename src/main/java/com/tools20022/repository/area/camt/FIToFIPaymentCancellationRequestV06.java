/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message is sent by a case creator/case
 * assigner to a case assignee.<br>
 * This message is used to request the cancellation of an original payment
 * instruction. The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message is exchanged
 * between the instructing agent and the instructed agent to request the
 * cancellation of a interbank payment message previously sent (such as
 * FIToFICustomerCreditTransfer, FIToFICustomerDirectDebit or
 * FinancialInstitutionCreditTransfer).<br>
 * <br>
 * The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest supports for both the request for
 * cancellation (the instructed agent - or assignee - has not yet processed and
 * forwarded the payment instruction) as well as the request for refund (payment
 * has been fully processed already by the instructed agent - or assignee).<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message must be answered with a:<br>
 * - ResolutionOfInvestigation message with a positive final outcome when the
 * case assignee can perform the requested cancellation<br>
 * - ResolutionOfInvestigation message with a negative final outcome when the
 * case assignee may perform the requested cancellation but fails to do so (too
 * late, irrevocable instruction, ...)<br>
 * - RejectInvestigation message when the case assignee is unable or not
 * authorised to perform the requested cancellation<br>
 * - NotificationOfCaseAssignment message to indicate whether the case assignee
 * will take on the case himself or reassign the case to a subsequent party in
 * the payment processing chain.<br>
 * A FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message concerns one and only one original
 * payment instruction at a time.<br>
 * When a case assignee successfully performs a cancellation, it must return the
 * corresponding funds to the case assigner. It may provide some details about
 * the return in the ResolutionOfInvestigation message.<br>
 * The processing of a FIToFI Payment Cancellation Request message case may lead
 * to a Debit Authorisation Request message sent to the creditor by its account
 * servicing institution.<br>
 * The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message may be used to escalate a case
 * after an unsuccessful request to modify the payment. In this scenario, the
 * case identification remains the same as in the original
 * FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message and the element ReopenCaseIndication
 * is set to 'Yes' or 'true'.<br>
 * The FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message has the following main
 * characteristics:<br>
 * Case Identification: The case creator assigns a unique case identification
 * and the reason code for the cancellation request. This information will be
 * passed unchanged to all subsequent case assignee(s). For the
 * FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest message the case has been made optional, as
 * the message might be used outside of a case management environment where the
 * case identification is not relevant.<br>
 * Moreover, the case identification may be present at different levels:<br>
 * - One unique case is defined per cancellation request message: If multiple
 * underlying groups or transactions are present in the message and the case
 * assignee has already forwarded the transaction for which the cancellation is
 * requested, the case cannot be forwarded to the next party in the chain (see
 * rule on uniqueness of the case) and the case creator will have to issue
 * individual cancellation requests for each underlying individual transaction.
 * In response to this cancellation request, the case must also be present at
 * the message level in the Resolution of Investigation message.<br>
 * - One case per original group or transaction present in the cancellation
 * request: For each group or transaction, a unique case has been assigned. This
 * means, when a payment instruction has already been forwarded by the case
 * assignee, the cancellation request may be forwarded to next party in the
 * payment chain, with the unique case assigned to the transaction. When the
 * group can only be cancelled partially, new cancellation requests need however
 * to be issued for the individual transactions within the group for which the
 * cancellation request has not been successful. In response to this
 * cancellation request, the case must be present in the cancellation details
 * identifying the original group or transaction in the Resolution of
 * Investigation message.<br>
 * - No case used in cancellation request message.<br>
 * Cancellation of a cover payment: The cancellation of a payment instruction
 * for which cover is provided by a separate instruction always results in the
 * cancellation of the whole transaction, including the cover. The case assignee
 * performing the cancellation must initiate the return of funds to the case
 * creator. The case assigner must not request the cancellation of the cover
 * separately.<br>
 * Cancellation request initiators: The cancellation of a payment instruction
 * can be initiated by either the debtor/creditor or any subsequent agent in the
 * payment instruction processing chain.
