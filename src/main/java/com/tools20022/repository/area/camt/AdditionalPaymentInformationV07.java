/**
 * <b>Scope</b><br>
 * The AdditionalPaymentInformation message is sent by an account servicing
 * institution to an account owner.<br>
 * This message is used to provide additional or corrected information on a
 * payment instruction or statement entry, in order to allow reconciliation.<br>
 * <b>Usage</b><br>
 * The AdditionalPaymentInformation message provides elements which are usually
 * not reported in a statement or advice (for example full remittance
 * information or identification of parties other than the account servicing
 * institution and the account owner). It complements information about a
 * payment instruction that has already been received, in the form of one or
 * several entries of the original payment instruction.<br>
 * The AdditionalPaymentInformation message covers one and only one original
 * payment instruction. If several payment instructions need further details,
 * multiple AdditionalPaymentInformation messages must be used, one for each of
 * the payment instructions.<br>
 * The AdditionalPaymentInformation message may be used as a result of two
 * investigation processes and in a way outlined below.<br>
 * - A ClaimNonReceipt workflow raised by the creditor or recipient of the
 * payment: This means that the payment instruction has reached the creditor or
 * beneficiary. The account owner needs further details or correct information
 * for its reconciliation processes. The AdditionalPaymentInformation can be
 * used to provide the missing information.<br>
 * - A RequestToModifyPayment workflow raised by the debtor or one of the
 * intermediate agents upstream: When the payment instruction has reached its
 * intended recipient and the modification does not affect the accounting at the
 * account servicing institution, this AdditionalPaymentInformation message
 * allows the account owner to receive further particulars or correct
 * information about a payment instruction or an entry passed to its account.<br>
 * The AdditionalPayment Information message cannot be used to trigger a request
 * for modification of a payment instruction activity. A RequestToModifyPayment
 * message must be used. In other words, if a debtor or one of intermediate
 * agent (excluding the account servicing institution of the creditor) realises
 * the some information was missing in the original payment instruction, he
 * should not use an AdditionalPaymentInformation but instead a
 * RequestToModifyPayment message.<br>
 * It is assumed that when an account servicing institution sends out an
 * AdditionalPaymentInformation message, the institution is fairly confident
 * that this will resolve the case. Therefore it does not need to wait for a
 * Resolution Of Investigation message. Neither does the account owner, or
 * whoever receives the additional information, need to send back a
 * ResolutionOfInvestigation message. Positive resolution in this case is
 * implicit. Both parties are expected to close the case. In the event that the
 * problem does not go away, a party can re-open the case.
